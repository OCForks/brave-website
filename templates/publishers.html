                <p>In the good old days, publishers created content and ads paid the way. But Internet ads are quickly becoming yesterday’s news. Ad blocking has grown significantly over the last few years. Now over 500 million people use software to stop ads on their mobile and desktop devices.

</p>
                <p>Without some change, smaller publishers could disappear and larger publishers' staff will continue shrinking. </p>

                        <p>Today, your visitors want minimal ads but you want maximum return for your great content. Brave gives both sides what they want.
                        <p>How does it work? Readers may choose a monthly contribution amount which is divided among the publisher sites they visit most. And as Brave grows, so does your revenue.</p>
                        <p>Here is the best part. Neither the readers nor the publisher need to do anything different. They just keep surfing and you just keep publishing. </p>
                        <p>Well, one small detail... you do need to collect your cash.</p></div></div>

                <h2>Claim your publisher contributions. </h2>
                <p>Once a user enables Brave Payments, the Brave browser automatically and anonymously keeps track of the publisher sites each user visits. The more times that a user visits a site, the larger the proportion of the user’s monthly contribution is “ear-marked” for that publisher. These funds grow as new micropayments are added. When contributions for a publisher exceed $100.00 USD, an email is sent to both the webmaster of the site and the registered domain owner from your WHOIS information. The email explains how to verify the ownership of your website with Brave Software.</p><br>


               <p>Brave Software uses a process similar to verifying a domain name to verify publisher sites. Just follow these steps:
                </p>
                <BR>
                <ul>

                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the email invitation sent from Brave Software to your webmaster. The email is titled "Brave Publisher Invitation" and includes all of the information needed to verify your site.</li><BR>

                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The email will direct you to a <a href="https://publishers.brave.com/">web page</a> where you will need to confirm your site ownership. The site will guide you through a simple process of adding a new record to your DNS host account. This ensures a secure handshake between Brave Software and you - preventing someone else from receiving your payments.
                </li><br>

                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> After verifying your site, you can view the current funds available for withdrawal. If you are ready to receive your funds, you may verify your wallet and submit the necessary tax forms.</li>

                <li><strong>Final Step:</strong> Check your wallet balance frequently, and transfer funds to wherever you choose. It's your money. You earned it! And - once you are verified, we welcome you to add a <a href="about.html#assets">Brave badge</a> to your site which will help lead your visitors to download Brave.</li>
