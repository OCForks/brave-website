                    <p>This privacy statement describes how our suite of Brave browsers for iOS, Android, macOS and Windows &#8220;<strong>Brave</strong>&#8221;, (&#8220;<strong>Brave</strong>&#8221;, &#8220;<strong>us</strong>&#8221;, &#8220;<strong>we</strong>&#8221; and/or &#8220;<strong>our</strong>&#8221;) collect and use the personal information you provide through Brave. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. Note, this privacy statement covers your use of the Brave browsers only. If you are visiting the Brave Software web site or using other Brave Software products or services, additional terms may apply.</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Brave is not in the business of selling personal information about you. We believe the best way to ensure your private information is protected is to make every effort to ensure we are not receiving your private information in the first place.</p>

                    <h2>Collection and Use</h2>

                    <h4>Brave for iOS and Brave for Android:</h4>

                    <p>We use a third party application performance analytics provider called Crashlytics to collect crash report data and other data about the usage of Brave. We do not store any user identifiable data, nor IP address, nor unique IDs. For more information on the type of data Crashlytics collects through Brave and how that data is used, please visit <a href="https://answers.io/img/privacy.pdf" target="_blank">https://answers.io/img/privacy.pdf</a>. The data collected by Crashlytics is provided to Brave in aggregated form through a crash report â€“ the report contains information about crashes, specifically what kind of device was being used when Brave crashed and which version was in use during the crash. We use these reports information to improve the overall performance of Brave. These crash reports do not include personally identifiable information or other personal account information.</p>

                    <h4>Brave for macOS and Windows:</h4>

                    <p>We collect user data regarding crashes and requests for updates. We do not store any personally identifiable data of our users, IP addresses, or unique IDs. We send a request to our server to see if an update is available and whether it was the first ever, first daily, first weekly, or first monthly request. These requests do not rely on third party software. We use a Node.js heroku server, which is based on Electron.</p>

Your continued use of Brave after any changes or revisions to this privacy statement shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised privacy statement.</p>
